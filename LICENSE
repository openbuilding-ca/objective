DISCLAIMER: (Disclaimer last updated: April 2025. Subject to change without notice.)
OpenBuilding, including its directors, advisors, and volunteers, makes no guarantees and assumes no legal responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this tool. 

Use at Your Own Risk: 
We have made reasonable efforts to review and ensure that the information provided is factually correct, comprehensive, and up-to-date. However, this tool and any related content should not be used as a substitute for the expertise of a licensed architect or engineer. Always consult a knowledgeable professional before using this tool to inform decisions.

This tool is designed to assist with evaluating energy and carbon targets during early-stage design only, and it is not a substitute for professional engineering or architectural services. Information in this tool may change and is not intended to cover all possible building types, system designs, building codes, standards, or occupancy scenarios. The absence of warnings does not imply that this tool is accurate, compliant with standards, effective, or appropriate for every situation.

Energy simulation or performance compliance methods cannot guarantee that a finished building will meet proposed targets due to factors beyond the control of any software, including user behavior, construction methods, site conditions, and climate variability. For example, weather data alone, over a 5-year period for the same Canadian location, can affect actual TEUI by up to 40%. Tools like OBJECTIVE are not intended to predict actual performance but to help set targets over a baseline or reference case.

As stated in an Informative Note from ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2013, "...actual experience will differ from these calculations due to variations such as occupancy, building operation and maintenance, weather, energy use not covered by this standard, changes in energy rates between design of the building and occupancy, and precision of the calculation tool."

Load calculations provided by a Mechanical Consultant take precedence over those generated by this tool. Architectural energy performance outputs should serve only as a reference for mechanical loads and to support data tables from Building Codes. Users must verify that any data in the 'Reference Values' section of this tool conforms to the most current and relevant sections of applicable building codes. We have provided some limited sample reference values to demonstrate how this section is intended to function but it is neither an exhaustive or complete list as there are simply far too many variables to add for every type of building occupancy and type, for every province in Canada. 

Building codes, standards, and professional regulations vary by province and territory. Users are responsible for ensuring compliance with local requirements.


This tool is intended for use by licensed professionals with the requisite insurance to undertake professional design activities in their respective jurisdiction in Canada. Use of this tool constitutes an acknowledgment that the user meets these qualifications and agrees to the terms of use stated here and agreed upon during download.
