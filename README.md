# OBJECTIVE TEUI Calculator

**Simple Energy and Carbon Modelling for Canadian Buildings**

OBJECTIVE is a web-based Total Energy Use Intensity (TEUI) and Thermal Energy Demand Intensity (TEDI) calculator designed for early-stage building design in Canada.

üåê **Live Demo:** [objective.openbuilding.ca](https://objective.openbuilding.ca)

---

## Overview

OBJECTIVE helps architects and engineers:
- Calculate TEUI and TEDI for building designs
- Compare target designs against code reference models
- Model energy performance across Canadian climate zones
- Export results for code compliance documentation

### Key Features

- **Dual-State Architecture** - Calculate both Target and Reference models simultaneously
- **18 Calculation Sections** - From climate data to mechanical loads
- **Canadian Climate Data** - Built-in data for cities across Canada
- **Import/Export** - Save and share calculations via Excel or CSV
- **Interactive Visualizations** - Sankey diagrams and dependency graphs
- **OBC Matrix Tool** - Ontario Building Code compliance matrix (included)

## Architecture

OBJECTIVE is built with vanilla JavaScript and runs entirely in the browser:

```
objective/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html              # Main calculator
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # State management, calculations
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sections/          # 18 calculator sections
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/            # Images, icons
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Climate data, reference values
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ obc/               # OBC Matrix tool
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                  # Technical documentation
```

Key architectural features:
- **No build step necessary** - Direct HTML/JS/CSS
- **Pure functional calculations** - Tuple-based dual-state logic
- **Modular sections** - Each section is independent
- **Local state persistence** - Browser localStorage
