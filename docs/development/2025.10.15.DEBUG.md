# Debug Session: October 15, 2025

## Session Summary

**Branch:** `REFERENCE-OVERLAY-COMPLETION`
**Starting Commit:** `2f00b37` (Add Anti-Pattern 6 and debugging methodology)
**Ending Commit:** `1427347` (Remove Anti-Pattern duplicate defaults in S11)

## Work Completed

### 1. Verbose Logging Cleanup ‚úÖ

**Commit:** `abff4b1` - üßπ CLEANUP: Remove verbose logging from S10, S12, and S01

**Removed 500+ verbose log statements:**

#### Section 10 (S10) - 461+ logs removed

- ‚ùå All `[S10DISPLAY]` individual variable display logs
- ‚ùå `[S10DISPLAY] g_80 DEBUG` special logging
- ‚ùå `[S10REF]` verbose utilization calc logs
- ‚úÖ Kept `[S10 DEBUG]` high-level logs (mode switches, calculateAll triggers)

#### Section 12 (S12) - 50+ logs removed

- ‚ùå `[S12DB]` detailed debug logs
- ‚ùå `[S12]` listener change logs
- ‚úÖ Kept section-level initialization and result storage logs

#### Section 01 (S01) - 20 logs removed

- ‚ùå `[S01DB]` upstream snapshot logs
- ‚ùå `[S01]` j_32 listener timing logs
- ‚úÖ Most S01 logs were already commented out

#### Preserved

- ‚úÖ All S11 logs kept intact for ongoing reference overlay debugging

**Rationale:** Logs were useful during debugging but now create noise. Kept high-level logs for future debugging.

### 2. Anti-Pattern Fix: Duplicate Defaults in S11 ‚úÖ

**Commit:** `1427347` - üîß FIX: Remove Anti-Pattern duplicate defaults in S11

**Issue Identified:**
S11 had hardcoded default values in `baselineValues` that duplicated values already defined in `ReferenceState.setDefaults()`, violating the cheatsheet Phase 5 principle: **"Field definitions are the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH"**

**The Problem:**

```javascript
// ‚ùå OLD: Three places with same values
const baselineValues = {
  85: { type: "rsi", value: 5.3 },  // Duplicated!
  86: { type: "rsi", value: 4.1 },  // Duplicated!
  88: { type: "uvalue", value: 1.99 }, // Duplicated!
  // ... etc
};

// Also in ReferenceState.setDefaults():
f_85: referenceValues.f_85 || "5.30",  // Same value!
g_88: referenceValues.g_88 || "1.990", // Same value!

// And dangerous triple-fallback:
inputValue = ReferenceState.getValue(rsiFieldId) ||
             baselineValues[rowNumber]?.value ||
             0;
```

**The Solution:**

```javascript
// ‚úÖ NEW: Type metadata only, values from single source
const componentTypes = {
  85: "rsi", // No values, just types
  86: "rsi",
  88: "uvalue",
  // ... etc
};

// Removed fallback - fail fast if missing:
inputValue = ReferenceState.getValue(rsiFieldId) || 0;
```

**Changes Made:**

1. Replaced `baselineValues` with `componentTypes` (type metadata only)
2. Removed dangerous triple-fallback chain
3. Updated `calculateTransmissionLoss()` to fail fast with 0 if Reference values missing
4. Updated `updateReferenceIndicators()` to use `componentTypes` for type detection

**Why This Matters:**

- Silent failures masked missing ReferenceState values
- Three sources of truth made debugging impossible
- Data drift risk if reference standards changed
- Now fails fast instead of hiding problems

**Files Modified:**

- `OBJECTIVE 4011RF/sections/4012-Section11.js`

**Testing Performed:**

- Reverted to pre-fix version to verify no regression
- Confirmed anti-pattern fix did NOT introduce new bugs
- Restored fix after verification

## Issue Discovered (Not Fixed - For Future Session)

### S11 Reference Mode Initial Area Display Issue

**Status:** üî¥ OPEN - Tracked for future debug session

**Description:**
When the app initializes, S11 in Reference mode does not properly display the default area values that were set in S10 Reference mode. However, changes made to S10 Reference mode DO flow to S11 and state isolation appears to be maintained.

**Observed Behavior:**

1. App initializes
2. User switches S10 to Reference mode UI - shows default areas
3. User switches S11 to Reference mode UI - areas are NOT showing S10 Reference defaults
4. Changes made in S10 Reference mode DO update S11 correctly after initialization

**Expected Behavior:**
When user first switches to S11 Reference mode, the area fields (d_88-d_93) should display the same values that S10 Reference mode has (which come from S10's ReferenceState defaults).

**Area Fields Affected:**

- `d_88` - Doors (from S10 `d_73`)
- `d_89` - Window North (from S10 `d_74`)
- `d_90` - Window East (from S10 `d_75`)
- `d_91` - Window South (from S10 `d_76`)
- `d_92` - Window West (from S10 `d_77`)
- `d_93` - Skylights (from S10 `d_78`)

**Hypothesis - Likely Causes:**

1. **Timing Issue:** `syncAreasFromS10()` runs before S10 ReferenceState is initialized

   - S11 tries to read from S10 Reference values that don't exist yet
   - Sync completes but finds no values to copy

2. **Mode Mismatch:** Sync only handles Target values, not Reference values

   - `syncAreasFromS10()` might only sync from S10's TargetState
   - Reference mode sync might not be implemented

3. **State Not Published:** Sync runs but doesn't publish to S11's ReferenceState
   - Values are synced but not stored in the right state object
   - Display reads from ReferenceState which is still empty

**Investigation Points for Next Session:**

1. Check `syncAreasFromS10()` implementation:

   - Does it sync Reference values or only Target?
   - When does it run during initialization?
   - Does it publish to both TargetState and ReferenceState?

2. Check S10 Reference initialization timing:

   - When does S10 ReferenceState.setDefaults() run?
   - When does S11 initialization run relative to S10?
   - Are there initialization order dependencies?

3. Check S11 Reference display logic:
   - Where does updateCalculatedDisplayValues() read area values from?
   - Does it correctly read from ReferenceState when in Reference mode?

**Code Locations to Review:**

- `4012-Section11.js`: `syncAreasFromS10()` function
- `4012-Section11.js`: ReferenceState initialization
- `4012-Section10.js`: ReferenceState.setDefaults()
- Initialization sequence in both sections

**Workaround:**
Users can manually adjust areas in S11 after switching to Reference mode, or make a change in S10 Reference mode which will trigger the sync.

## Commit History

```
1427347 üîß FIX: Remove Anti-Pattern duplicate defaults in S11

```

**Revert Point:** If issues occur, revert to `abff4b1` (stable after logging cleanup, before anti-pattern fix)

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Remove verbose logging from S10, S12, S01
- ‚úÖ Fix Anti-Pattern duplicate defaults in S11
- ‚úÖ Document S11 Reference initialization issue

### Future Debug Session

1. Investigate S11 Reference area initialization issue
2. Implement proper sync of S10 Reference areas to S11 Reference on initialization
3. Add logging to trace initialization sequence timing
4. Test Reference mode display after initialization fix

---

## Notes

- S11 logs preserved for ongoing reference overlay work
- Anti-pattern fix confirmed safe via revert testing
- State isolation between Target/Reference modes working correctly for live updates
- Only initialization display is affected, not ongoing sync behavior
