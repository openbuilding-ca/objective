# Reference Mode Calculation Flow Regression

## üö® Critical Issue - Post-Import Reference Mode Blocked

**Date Discovered**: October 22, 2025
**Severity**: HIGH - Reference mode calculations broken after file import
**Status**: INVESTIGATING

---

## Symptom Summary

**Target Mode**: ‚úÖ Works correctly in all scenarios
**Reference Mode After Initialization**: ‚úÖ Works correctly
**Reference Mode After File Import**: ‚ùå BROKEN - calculations don't flow through system

### Working Sections (Reference Mode After Import)

- ‚úÖ **S03** - Climate data
- ‚úÖ **S07** - Water Use
- ‚úÖ **S13** - Mechanical Loads

### Broken Sections (Reference Mode After Import)

- ‚ùå **S10** - Radiant Gains (user changes don't propagate)
- ‚ùå **S11** - Transmission Losses (TB% slider changes don't propagate)
- ‚ùå **S12** - Volume Metrics (user changes don't propagate)

**Pattern**: S10, S11, S12 are sequential dependencies. Changes made in these sections update their own internal calculations but **do not flow downstream** to other sections.

---

## Reproduction Steps

### Scenario 1: Initialization (WORKS ‚úÖ)

1. Hard refresh page (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Click "Initialize" button
3. Navigate to S11
4. Switch to Reference mode
5. Change TB% slider from 0% to 20%
6. **Result**: ‚úÖ Changes flow through ‚Üí S12 updates ‚Üí downstream sections update ‚Üí e_10 updates

### Scenario 2: After Import (BROKEN ‚ùå)

1. Hard refresh page
2. Import Excel file
3. Navigate to S11
4. Switch to Reference mode
5. Change TB% slider from 0% to 20%
6. **Result**: ‚ùå S11 updates internally, but NO downstream propagation ‚Üí e_10 does NOT update

### Scenario 3: S12 After Import (BROKEN ‚ùå)

1. Import Excel file
2. Navigate to S12
3. Switch to Reference mode
4. Change d_103 (Stories) or g_109 (ACH50)
5. **Result**: ‚ùå S12 updates internally, but NO downstream propagation

---

## Technical Context

### What Changed Recently

**Commit `38da9c6`**: Removed self-listeners in S12

- **Intent**: Fix double calculation issue
- **Change**: Removed StateManager listeners for S12's own input fields
- **Reason**: Following S07 pattern where user edits trigger calculations directly

**Question**: Did removing self-listeners break something in the import flow?

### Key Differences: Init vs Import

#### Initialization Flow

1. `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs
2. Each section's `calculateAll()` runs both engines
3. Results published to StateManager
4. Listeners trigger dependent sections
5. ‚úÖ Full calculation chain completes

#### Import Flow

1. Quarantine listeners (muted)
2. Import Target values ‚Üí StateManager
3. Import Reference values ‚Üí StateManager
4. `syncPatternASections()` - sections sync from StateManager
5. Unquarantine listeners (unmuted)
6. `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs
7. ‚ùì **Something different happens here**

---

## Hypotheses

### Hypothesis 1: Listener Muting Issue

**Theory**: Import process mutes listeners, and they don't properly re-engage for Reference mode after unmuting.

**Evidence Needed**:

- Check if `ref_*` value changes during import trigger listeners
- Verify listener registration state after import completes

### Hypothesis 2: State Contamination During Import

**Theory**: Import process populates states in a way that breaks the calculation chain for Reference mode.

**Evidence Needed**:

- Compare state of `ReferenceState` after init vs after import
- Check if `ref_*` values are properly published to StateManager during import

### Hypothesis 3: Double Calculation Prevention Gone Wrong

**Theory**: Removing self-listeners in S12 (commit `38da9c6`) broke something specific to the import flow.

**Evidence Needed**:

- Test if reverting `38da9c6` fixes the issue
- Compare S07 (working) vs S12 (broken) listener patterns

### Hypothesis 4: ModeManager.setValue() Publishing Issue

**Theory**: After import, `ModeManager.setValue()` might not be publishing `ref_*` values correctly.

**Evidence Needed**:

- Add console logging to `ModeManager.setValue()` in S11, S12
- Check if `ref_*` values are being published when user edits in Reference mode
- Verify StateManager receives the updates

---

## Investigation Plan

### Phase 1: Establish Baseline (Console Logging)

1. Add logging to S11's `ModeManager.setValue()` to see if it publishes `ref_d_97` when TB% changes
2. Add logging to S12's `ModeManager.setValue()` to see if it publishes `ref_g_109` when ACH50 changes
3. Add logging to `StateManager.setValue()` to see what's being published
4. Test both init and import scenarios, compare logs

### Phase 2: Listener Verification

1. Check if `ref_*` listeners exist and are registered after import
2. Verify listeners fire when `ref_*` values change
3. Compare listener behavior init vs import

### Phase 3: Calculation Chain Trace

1. Add detailed logging to `calculateAll()` in S11, S12
2. Log when both engines run
3. Log what results are published to StateManager
4. Trace why downstream sections don't see the changes

### Phase 4: Root Cause Identification

Based on logging evidence, identify:

- Where the calculation chain breaks
- Why it works after init but not after import
- What specific change caused the regression

---

## Expected Behavior

When user changes a value in Reference mode (after init OR after import):

1. `handleFieldBlur` fires
2. `ModeManager.setValue(fieldId, value)` publishes `ref_fieldId` to StateManager
3. `handleFieldBlur` calls `calculateAll()`
4. Both engines run (Target + Reference)
5. Results published to StateManager (both unprefixed + `ref_` prefixed)
6. Downstream sections' listeners see changes
7. Downstream sections recalculate
8. Full chain completes ‚Üí e_10 updates

**Current Reality After Import**: Steps 1-5 work, but steps 6-8 fail.

---

## Next Steps

1. Create diagnostic logging in key sections
2. Test init scenario - capture logs
3. Test import scenario - capture logs
4. Compare and identify divergence point
5. Fix root cause
6. Verify fix works for both init and import

---

## Test Results

### Test 1: INITIALIZATION BASELINE (Working ‚úÖ)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test**: Change d_103 (Stories) from 1 to 1.5 in Reference mode after initialization

**Initial State**: e_10 = 287.0
**After Change**: e_10 = 289.9 ‚úÖ (Updated correctly!)
**Target h_10**: No change (correct - only Reference engine should update)

**S12 Diagnostic Logs (Key Events)**:

```
[S12 DIAG] setValue in REFERENCE mode: ref_d_103 = 1.5 (source=user-modified)
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Published ref_d_103 to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] setValue in REFERENCE mode: ref_d_103 = 1.5 (source=user-modified)
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Published ref_d_103 to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll START (mode=reference) ==========
[S12 DIAG] Running Reference engine...
[S12 DIAG] Running Target engine...
[S12 DIAG] Re-publishing 34 Reference results...
[S12 DIAG] ‚úÖ Reference results re-published to StateManager
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll END ==========
```

**Analysis**:

1. ‚úÖ `ref_d_103` published to StateManager (appears twice - likely dropdown change event)
2. ‚úÖ `calculateAll()` runs in reference mode
3. ‚úÖ Both engines execute (dual-engine architecture working)
4. ‚úÖ 34 Reference results re-published to StateManager
5. ‚úÖ **Downstream propagation works** - e_10 updates from 287.0 ‚Üí 289.9
6. ‚úÖ Target values unaffected (h_10 no change)

**Conclusion**: After initialization, Reference mode calculation flow works perfectly. All values publish correctly and downstream sections respond to changes.

---

### Test 2: POST-IMPORT (BROKEN ‚ùå)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test**: Same as Test 1, but after Excel file import instead of initialization

**Initial State**: e_10 = 910.8
**After Change**: Changed d_103 from 2 to 1.5 in Reference mode
**Result**: e_10 remains 910.8 ‚ùå (NO propagation!)

**S12 Diagnostic Logs**: IDENTICAL to Test 1! ‚úÖ

**Critical Finding**:
S12's behavior is **identical** in both scenarios:

- ‚úÖ Publishes `ref_d_103` to StateManager
- ‚úÖ Runs both engines (Reference + Target)
- ‚úÖ Re-publishes 34 Reference results to StateManager

**The Problem is DOWNSTREAM**: Other sections (S13, S14, S04, S01) are not responding to S12's published values after import.

---

## Phase 2: Expanded Diagnostic Logging (Commit `ccc5fe0`)

**Objective**: Track the full calculation chain to identify where propagation breaks after import.

**New Logging Added**:

### Calculator.js (4011-Calculator.js)

```
[CALC-FLOW] üéØ Calculator.calculateAll() START
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect12.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect12.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect13.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect13.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect14.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect14.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect04.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect04.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üîÑ Running sect01.calculateAll()...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ sect01.calculateAll() completed
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ Calculator.calculateAll() END
```

### Section 13 (4012-Section13.js)

```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S13.calculateAll() START (mode=reference)
[CALC-FLOW] üì§ S13 re-publishing N Reference results...
[CALC-FLOW] ‚úÖ S13 Reference results published to StateManager
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ S13.calculateAll() END
```

### Section 04 (4012-Section04.js)

```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S04.calculateAll() START (mode=reference)
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ S04.calculateAll() END (ref_j_32=VALUE)
```

### Section 01 (4012-Section01.js)

```
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S01.updateTEUIDisplay() reading ref_j_32=VALUE, ref_h_15=VALUE
```

**What to Look For in Test 3**:

1. Does `Calculator.calculateAll()` run after S12 user edit?
2. Do all sections (S13, S14, S04, S01) execute?
3. Does S13 re-publish Reference results in Reference mode?
4. What is the `ref_j_32` value at S04 output?
5. What `ref_j_32` value does S01 read?
6. Are the values flowing through the chain, or stuck somewhere?

---

### Test 3: POST-IMPORT WITH EXPANDED LOGGING (COMPLETED ‚ùå)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test Protocol**: Same as Test 2

**Result**: e_10 remains 910.8 ‚ùå (NO propagation!)

**CRITICAL FINDING**: `Calculator.calculateAll()` does NOT run!

**Evidence from Logs**:

- ‚úÖ S12 logs show: `[S12 DIAG] calculateAll START/END`
- ‚úÖ S12 publishes 34 Reference results to StateManager
- ‚úÖ S10 listener fires: "S10: Reference listener triggered by ref_i_103"
- ‚ùå **NO `[CALC-FLOW]` logs from Calculator.calculateAll()**
- ‚ùå **NO `[CALC-FLOW]` logs from S13, S14, S04, S01**

**Analysis**:
S12's `handleFieldBlur` calls `calculateAll()` which is S12's **local** function, NOT `Calculator.calculateAll()`. According to CHEATSHEET.md, this is correct architecture - sections call their own `calculateAll()`, and downstream propagation happens through StateManager listeners.

**The Problem**:

- S12 publishes `ref_i_103` ‚Üí S10 listener fires ‚úÖ
- But S10's recalculation doesn't cascade further
- S13, S14, S04, S01 never run
- No full system recalculation happens

**Key Question**: Why did Test 1 work if Calculator.calculateAll() wasn't called then either?

**Hypothesis**: After init, cascading StateManager listeners worked correctly. After import, something breaks the listener cascade.

---

### Test 4: PRE-IMPORT WITH LOGGING (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Objective**: Verify if `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs during Test 1 scenario

**Test Protocol**: Same as Test 1, with diagnostic logging enabled

**Result**: e_10 updates correctly: 287.0 ‚Üí 289.9 ‚úÖ

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Cascading StateManager listeners work after init!

**Evidence from Logs**:

```
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll START ==========
S10: Reference listener triggered by ref_i_103, recalculating all.
[S10 DEBUG] calculateAll() triggered...
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S04.calculateAll() START (mode=target)
[CALC-FLOW] üèÅ S04.calculateAll() END (ref_j_32=413763.1686081366)
[CALC-FLOW] üìä S01.updateTEUIDisplay() reading ref_j_32=413763.1686081366
```

**Analysis**:

1. ‚úÖ S12 publishes ref_i_103
2. ‚úÖ S10 listener fires synchronously
3. ‚úÖ **Cascade continues to S04** (something S10 publishes triggers S04)
4. ‚úÖ **Cascade reaches S01** (which reads ref_j_32 from S04)
5. ‚úÖ e_10 updates correctly

**The Architecture (CONFIRMED)**:

- Sections call their **own** `calculateAll()` (not Calculator.calculateAll)
- Cascading **StateManager listeners** propagate changes synchronously
- Chain: S12 ‚Üí S10 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01 (via listeners)

**Comparison: Test 3 vs Test 4**

| Step                    | Test 4 (After Init) ‚úÖ | Test 3 (After Import) ‚ùå |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| S12 publishes ref_i_103 | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| S10 listener fires      | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| S10.calculateAll() runs | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚úÖ Yes                   |
| **Cascade to S04**      | ‚úÖ **YES**             | ‚ùå **NO**                |
| **Cascade to S01**      | ‚úÖ **YES**             | ‚ùå **NO**                |
| e_10 updates            | ‚úÖ Yes                 | ‚ùå No                    |

**THE BUG**: After import, the listener cascade **stops at S10**. Something S10 publishes should trigger downstream sections (S04, S01), but those listeners don't fire after import.

---

## Phase 3: Listener Firing Diagnostics (Commit `e340691`)

**Objective**: Determine if listeners are registered and firing after import.

**New Logging Added**: StateManager.notifyListeners() now logs when listeners fire for `ref_d_103`, `ref_i_103`, `ref_g_103`.

### Test 5: POST-IMPORT WITH LISTENER DIAGNOSTICS (COMPLETED ‚ùå)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test Protocol**: Same as Test 3 (import, then edit d_103 in Reference mode)

**Result**: e_10 remains 910.8 ‚ùå

**CRITICAL FINDING**: **Listeners ARE registered and firing!**

**Evidence from Logs**:

```
[CALC-FLOW] üîî Firing 4 listeners for ref_i_103
S10: Reference listener triggered by ref_i_103, recalculating all.
[S10 DEBUG] calculateAll() triggered in target mode - running both engines
[S10 DEBUG] Dual-engine calculations complete in target mode
[S12 DIAG] ========== calculateAll END ==========
```

**Analysis**:

1. ‚úÖ **4 listeners registered** for ref_i_103
2. ‚úÖ **Listeners fire** after import (not muted)
3. ‚úÖ **S10 runs** both engines
4. ‚ùå **Cascade stops** - No S13, S14, S04, S01

**The Problem**: S10's listener fires and S10 calculates, but **nothing downstream runs**.

Investigation shows:

- S04 listens to: S13 (d_113, h_115, f_115), S15 (d_136), S06, S07, S08, S09, S02
- S04 does **NOT** listen to S10 outputs directly
- The cascade must go: S10 ‚Üí ??? ‚Üí S13 ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01

**Working Theory**: The architecture expects `Calculator.calculateAll()` to run the full cascade, not individual section listeners. After init, something triggers `Calculator.calculateAll()`, but after import it doesn't.

---

## Root Cause & Solution

### The Problem (Confirmed)

**Incomplete Listener Cascade**:

- S12 ‚Üí S10 works (S10 listener fires)
- S10 ‚Üí S11 ‚Üí S13 ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01 **BREAKS** (no listeners connect these)

**Why It Works After Init**:

- During init, `Calculator.calculateAll()` runs the full ordered sequence
- This populates all values correctly
- Subsequent user edits work because all values are already "primed"

**Why It Breaks After Import**:

- Import runs `Calculator.calculateAll()` once
- But when user edits S12, only S12's local `calculateAll()` runs
- S10 listener fires, but S10's outputs don't trigger downstream cascade
- S11, S13, S14, S04, S01 never recalculate with new S10 area values

### The S13 Pattern (Working Example)

S13 correctly handles this with `g_118` (Ventilation Method):

```javascript
// 4012-Section13.js:2237-2244
if (fieldId === "g_118") {
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();
    }
  }, 50); // Small delay ensures S13 values published first
}
```

**Why this works**: S13 knows that ventilation changes affect many downstream sections, so it triggers the full `Calculator.calculateAll()` cascade.

### Proposed Solution

**Apply the S13 pattern to S10 and S12**:

#### Fix 1: S10's calculateAll() should trigger full cascade

```javascript
// 4012-Section10.js:1900
function calculateAll() {
  console.log(
    `[S10 DEBUG] calculateAll() triggered in ${ModeManager.currentMode} mode - running both engines`,
  );

  calculateTargetModel(); // Calculate Target model values
  calculateReferenceModel(); // Calculate Reference model values

  console.log(
    `[S10 DEBUG] Dual-engine calculations complete in ${ModeManager.currentMode} mode`,
  );

  // ‚úÖ FIX: S10 exports door/window/skylight areas to S11
  // When areas change, must trigger full cascade (S11 ‚Üí S12 ‚Üí S13 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí S01)
  // Pattern from S13's g_118 handling
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();
    }
  }, 50);
}
```

#### Fix 2: S12's handleFieldBlur() should trigger full cascade

```javascript
// 4012-Section12.js:2544
function handleFieldBlur(event) {
  const field = event.target;
  const fieldId = field.getAttribute("data-field-id");
  if (!fieldId) return;

  const numValue = window.TEUI.parseNumeric(field.textContent);
  if (!isNaN(numValue) && isFinite(numValue)) {
    const formattedValue = window.TEUI.formatNumber(numValue, "number-2dp");
    field.textContent = formattedValue;

    console.log(
      `[S12 DIAG] handleFieldBlur: ${fieldId} = ${numValue} (mode=${ModeManager.currentMode})`,
    );

    // ‚úÖ DUAL-STATE: Store value using ModeManager
    ModeManager.setValue(fieldId, String(numValue), "user-modified");

    console.log(`[S12 DIAG] Calling calculateAll() after user edit...`);

    // ‚úÖ FIX: Call Calculator.calculateAll() instead of local calculateAll()
    // S12 volume/surface changes affect S13 (mechanical loads), S14 (TEDI), S04 (totals), S01 (display)
    // Must trigger full cascade, not just S12's engines
    if (window.TEUI?.Calculator?.calculateAll) {
      window.TEUI.Calculator.calculateAll();
    } else {
      // Fallback to local if Calculator not available
      calculateAll();
    }

    console.log(`[S12 DIAG] calculateAll() completed`);
  }
}
```

### Why This Fixes The Issue

1. **After Init**: Works as before (Calculator.calculateAll runs during init)
2. **After Import**: User edits now trigger full cascade
   - S12 user edit ‚Üí `Calculator.calculateAll()` ‚Üí Full ordered sequence
   - S10 listener fires ‚Üí `Calculator.calculateAll()` ‚Üí Full ordered sequence
3. **Consistent with CHEATSHEET**: Sections run both engines, then trigger cascade when needed

### Trade-offs

**Pros**:

- Fixes Reference mode regression
- Follows S13's proven pattern
- Ensures consistency between init and post-import behavior

**Cons**:

- May cause duplicate calculations (Calculator runs all sections, including ones that just ran)
- Performance impact (acceptable for correctness)

### Alternative Considered

Complete the listener chain (S10 ‚Üí S11 ‚Üí S13 ‚Üí S04). **Rejected** because:

- Complex to implement correctly
- Risk of breaking existing working patterns
- S13 pattern is already proven and simpler

---

## Phase 4: Import Process Investigation (Commit `409078b`)

### Clarified Understanding

**User Clarification**: The issue is specifically **user edits AFTER import**:

- ‚úÖ After Init ‚Üí User Edits: Work perfectly
- ‚úÖ After Import ‚Üí Initial Calculation: Works perfectly
- ‚ùå After Import ‚Üí User Edits: Broken

**Key Insight**: Import itself runs `Calculator.calculateAll()` successfully. But something during the import process breaks the listener cascade for _subsequent_ user interactions.

### New Hypothesis: Import Corrupts Listener State

The import process:

1. Mutes listeners (`muteListeners()`)
2. Imports values
3. Syncs Pattern A sections (`syncPatternASections()`)
4. Unmutes listeners (`unmuteListeners()`)
5. Runs `Calculator.calculateAll()`

**Something in steps 1-4 corrupts the listener registry or state.**

### Test 6: Listener Count Before/After Import (COMPLETED ‚úÖ‚ùå)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test Protocol**: Import file, check listener counts, then edit d_103

**CRITICAL FINDING**: **Listeners are INTACT - the problem is elsewhere!**

**Evidence from Logs**:

```
[StateManager] üìä BEFORE MUTE: 658 listeners across 211 fields
[StateManager] üìä AFTER UNMUTE: 658 listeners across 211 fields
[StateManager] üîç ref_i_103 has 4 listeners registered
[CALC-FLOW] üîî Firing 4 listeners for ref_i_103
S10: Reference listener triggered by ref_i_103, recalculating all.
[S10 DEBUG] calculateAll() triggered in target mode - running both engines
[S10 DEBUG] Dual-engine calculations complete in target mode
```

**Analysis**:

1. ‚úÖ **658 listeners survive import perfectly** (no corruption)
2. ‚úÖ **ref_i_103 has 4 listeners** after unmute
3. ‚úÖ **Listeners fire** correctly after user edit
4. ‚úÖ **S10 runs** both engines
5. ‚ùå **Cascade still stops** - no S13, S14, S04, S01

**BREAKTHROUGH OBSERVATION**:
S10's debug log says `triggered in target mode` even though we're editing in Reference mode. S10 runs both engines, but it may not be **publishing** Reference results to StateManager after import!

**Hypothesis Shift**: The issue isn't listener registry corruption. The issue is that **S10's Reference engine results aren't being published to StateManager** after import, so downstream listeners have nothing to respond to.

---

## The Real Culprit: S10

**Investigation Focus**: S10 is the break point in the cascade.

After import, when S10's listener fires and S10 runs:

- ‚úÖ S10.calculateAll() executes
- ‚úÖ Both engines run (Target + Reference)
- ‚ùå **Reference results don't propagate downstream**

**Next Step**: Narrow diagnostic focus to S10's Reference result publishing mechanism. Something about import state prevents S10 from publishing ref_d_73, ref_d_74, etc. to StateManager.

---

## Test 7: S10 Reference Publishing Diagnostics (COMPLETED ‚úÖ)

**Date**: October 22, 2025
**Test Protocol**: Import file, then edit d_103 in S12 Reference mode, check S10 diagnostics

**CRITICAL BREAKTHROUGH**: **S10 IS publishing Reference values perfectly!**

**Evidence from Logs**:

```
S10: Reference listener triggered by ref_i_103, recalculating all.
[S10 DEBUG] calculateAll() triggered in target mode - running both engines
[S10 DIAG] üîÑ storeReferenceResults() called
[S10 DIAG] ‚úÖ Published 6 Reference area values to StateManager
[S10 DEBUG] Dual-engine calculations complete in target mode
```

**Analysis**:

1. ‚úÖ S10.calculateAll() executes when ref_i_103 changes
2. ‚úÖ storeReferenceResults() IS called
3. ‚úÖ **All 6 Reference area values** (ref_d_73-78, ref_d_88-93) are published to StateManager
4. ‚ùå **Downstream cascade still doesn't happen**

**THE REAL BUG DISCOVERED**: S10 is publishing ref_d_73-78 correctly, but **S11's Reference area listeners aren't firing**!

### Root Cause: Mode Guard in S11 Listeners

**File**: `4012-Section11.js:1342-1352`

```javascript
// Listen for Reference mode changes
s10AreaFields.forEach((fieldId) => {
  window.TEUI.StateManager.addListener(`ref_${fieldId}`, (newValue) => {
    // GUARD: Only fire if Reference mode active
    if (ModeManager.currentMode !== "reference") return; // ‚ùå BUG!

    console.log(
      `[S11 Listener] ref_${fieldId} changed to ${newValue} (Reference mode)`,
    );
    debouncedSyncAreasFromS10();
  });
});
```

**The Problem**:

- S12 is in Reference mode (its own ModeManager)
- S12 publishes ref_i_103 ‚Üí S10 listener fires ‚úÖ
- S10 publishes ref_d_73-78 to StateManager ‚úÖ
- **S11 is still in Target mode** (each section has independent mode state)
- S11's listener guard checks `if (ModeManager.currentMode !== "reference") return;`
- **Guard blocks the listener from firing** ‚ùå
- Cascade stops at S11

**Architectural Insight**: Pattern A sections have **independent mode states**. S12 can be in Reference mode while S11 is in Target mode. The listener guard incorrectly assumes that if `ref_*` values are changing, S11 must also be in Reference mode - this is FALSE in the dual-state architecture!

### The Fix

**Remove the mode guard from S11's Reference area listeners**. The listeners should fire whenever ref_d_73-78 values change, regardless of S11's current mode. The dual-engine architecture ensures both engines run anyway, so mode guards on listeners are unnecessary and harmful.

```javascript
// Listen for Reference mode changes
s10AreaFields.forEach((fieldId) => {
  window.TEUI.StateManager.addListener(`ref_${fieldId}`, (newValue) => {
    // ‚úÖ REMOVED MODE GUARD - listeners should fire regardless of S11's mode
    // GUARD: Only fire if S11 initialized
    if (!isS11Initialized) return;

    console.log(
      `[S11 Listener] ref_${fieldId} changed to ${newValue} (Reference mode)`,
    );
    debouncedSyncAreasFromS10();
  });
});
```

**Why This Fixes It**:

1. When S10 publishes ref_d_73-78 (from any section's Reference edit)
2. S11 listeners fire regardless of S11's current mode
3. S11 syncs area values and runs calculateAll() (both engines)
4. S11 publishes results ‚Üí cascade continues to S13 ‚Üí S14 ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01
5. Full Reference cascade works after import ‚úÖ

**Why the Same Guard on Target Listeners is OK**:
Target mode listeners have the guard `if (ModeManager.currentMode !== "target") return;` which is fine because:

- Target is the default mode for all sections at init
- User edits in one section's Target mode won't affect other sections in Target mode
- The architecture expects Target mode to be globally consistent

But **Reference mode is section-specific** - one section can be in Reference mode while others are in Target mode, so Reference listeners must NOT have mode guards.

## CRITICAL DISCOVERY: S10/S11 State Mixing (October 22, 2025)

**SEVERITY**: BLOCKER - Fundamental architectural corruption

### The Problem

**Symptom**: Edits made to S10 in **Target mode** are flowing to the **Reference model**, NOT the Target model.

**User Discovery**:

> "I just noticed a major flaw with state mixing in S10, S11. Edits made to Target mode of S10 flow to the Reference model, NOT The Target model. It is all kinds of messed up and I honestly never even noticed this until now."

### Historical Investigation

**Time Machine Backups Checked**:

- October 15, 2025 and earlier: **State mixing present in ALL versions**

**Timeline Hypothesis**:
The corruption likely occurred AFTER the 'FINAL BOSS' or 'SON-OF-A-BOSS' bug fixes, when we implemented quality-of-life changes to write S10 area values to S11 file.

### Root Cause Theory

The S10‚ÜíS11 area synchronization mechanism introduced during/after the boss bug fixes may have:

1. Mixed up Target vs Reference value publishing
2. Incorrectly mapped state prefixes (ref\_ vs unprefixed)
3. Created listener crosswalk between modes

### What We Know

**Working Before**:

- 'FINAL BOSS' and 'SON-OF-A-BOSS' branches were successfully fixed
- System worked correctly at some point

**Broken After**:

- S10 area export to S11 was added as quality-of-life improvement
- State mixing began (date unknown)
- Present in all backups from Oct 15 backward

### Next Steps - PAUSED

1. **User Action Required**: Explore Time Machine backups to find:

   - Last known-good version where S10 Target‚ÜíTarget and Reference‚ÜíReference work correctly
   - First broken version where state mixing appears
   - Identify the specific commit/change that introduced the corruption

2. **Once Found**: Compare the working vs broken S10/S11 files to identify:

   - Incorrect state publishing logic
   - Listener registration errors
   - ModeManager setValue() misuse
   - StateManager prefix confusion

3. **Fix Strategy**:
   - Revert S10/S11 to known-good baseline
   - Re-apply only the necessary S10‚ÜíS11 area sync feature
   - Ensure strict separation: Target mode edits ‚Üí unprefixed values, Reference mode edits ‚Üí ref\_ values
   - Add defensive diagnostics to detect state mixing early

### Current Work SUSPENDED

- S11 mode guard fix (commit c416526): **INCOMPLETE** - May be addressing wrong problem
- Reference mode cascade investigation: **ON HOLD** - Cannot debug cascade until state mixing is fixed
- All diagnostic logging: **REMOVED** - S10 reverted to clean baseline (commit e4939fd)
