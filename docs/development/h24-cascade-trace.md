# h_24 Cascade Trace - State Mixing Investigation

## The Question
**Why does editing l_24 in Target mode cause BOTH h_10 and e_10 to change?**
- Expected: Only h_10 (Target total) should change
- Bug: e_10 (Reference total) also changes (182.2 ‚Üí 198)

## h_24 Value Change Cascade (Target Mode)

### Step 1: User Edit
```
User edits l_24 in S03 (Target mode)
‚Üì
S03 ModeManager.setValue("l_24", newValue)
‚Üì
S03 calculateTargetModel()
  ‚Üì calculateCoolingSetpoint_h24()
    ‚Üì h_24 = IF(l_24 > 24, l_24, 24)
    ‚Üì setFieldValue("h_24", h_24)
      ‚Üì StateManager.setValue("h_24", value)  [UNPREFIXED - Target value]
```

### Step 2: h_24 Listener Cascade
```
StateManager.setValue("h_24") triggers listeners:
  ‚Üì
  Cooling.js listener fires
    ‚Üì calculateStage1("target")
      ‚Üì Publishes cooling_h_124, latentLoadFactor, etc.
```

### Step 3: Pattern A Dual-Engine Execution
**THIS IS WHERE THE PROBLEM LIKELY OCCURS**

Both engines run (correct per Pattern A):
```
calculateAll() runs in multiple sections:
  ‚Üì
  S13.calculateAll()
    ‚îú‚îÄ calculateTargetModel() ‚Üí Uses Target values ‚úÖ
    ‚îî‚îÄ calculateReferenceModel() ‚Üí Should use Reference values ‚ùå
       ‚Üì
       Calls: Cooling.calculateAll("reference")
       ‚Üì
       Question: Does this contaminate Reference with Target data?
```

### Step 4: Cascade to S01
```
S13 publishes values ‚Üí S14 ‚Üí S15 ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01
                                         ‚Üì
                                    updateTEUIDisplay()
                                         ‚Üì
                                    Calculates e_10 from upstream totals
                                         ‚Üì
                                    ‚ùå BUG: e_10 = 198 (changed from 182.2)
```

## Debug Log Evidence

From improved debug script (3,030 lines):

```
BEFORE edit:
  e_10 = 182.2 (Reference total - from debug logs)
  h_10 = 93.72 (Target total)

USER EDITS l_24 in Target mode

AFTER edit (from debug logs):
  e_10 = 198 ‚Üê CHANGED! (Reference contaminated)
  h_10 = 90.91 ‚Üê Changed (expected)

Call stack for e_10 write:
  at updateTEUIDisplay (Section01.js:876)
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DISCREPANCY (Oct 31, 12:00am)**:
- Debug logs show: e_10 = 182.2 (before) ‚Üí 198 (after)
- **User reports UI actually shows: e_10 = 197.7** (final value after full initialization)
- Excel parity target: e_10 = 196.6
- **197.7 is MUCH CLOSER to Excel than 182.2!**

**IMPLICATIONS**:
1. Debug script may not capture final settled value after all initialization completes
2. There may be additional calculation cycles AFTER the debug logs stop
3. The value 182.2 may be INCOMPLETE, not fully initialized
4. The value 197.7 (seen in UI) is nearly correct (196.6 target)
5. **REVISED HYPOTHESIS**: Problem may be initialization sequence, not l_24 edit cascade
6. Need to investigate WHY initial value is 182.2 vs final value 197.7

## Key Observations

1. ‚úÖ ref_cooling_h_124 stayed constant at 48381.43968
   - Our h_24 fix IS working for Cooling.js

2. ‚ö†Ô∏è e_10 changes in logs BUT settles correctly in UI
   - Contamination may be happening DURING initialization
   - Final settled value (197.7) is nearly correct (Excel: 196.6)
   - In the S13 ‚Üí S14 ‚Üí S15 ‚Üí S04 ‚Üí S01 cascade

3. üîç **NEW FOCUS**: Initialization order/timing, not just edit cascade
   - Why does e_10 start at 182.2 instead of 197.7?
   - What calculation pass brings it from 182.2 ‚Üí 197.7?
   - Is there a race condition during initialization?

## Hypothesis: Contamination Source

The contamination is likely in **one of these sections**:
- **S13**: Calculates energy values, passes to S14/S15
- **S14**: TEDI calculations
- **S15**: Energy summary
- **S04**: Energy/emissions totals
- **S01**: Display (reads from upstream)

**Most likely**: S13, S14, or S15 have a non-mode-aware read similar to what we found in Cooling.js

## Next Investigation Steps

1. Search for ALL `StateManager.getValue()` calls in S13, S14, S15, S04
2. Check if any read unprefixed values when they should read ref_ prefixed
3. Focus on cooling-related fields: m_129, d_129, cooling_m_124, h_124
4. Check if Reference calculations in these sections use mode-aware reads
